# Typesense Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 5.8.4.2 - 2026-10-28
### Fixed
- When an element is removed from a site (e.g. a section's propagation method changes, or its site statuses are edited), its document is now removed from that site's collections. Previously it stayed until the next sync
- When removing a document, a resolver that returns nothing (e.g. for a disabled element, or one from another site) now falls back to deleting by element ID, as a failing resolver already did. Previously the document was left in the collection
- A Typesense error while saving an element in a queue job or console command no longer fails the job: the error is logged, and the control panel flash message is only set for web requests

## 5.8.4.1 - 2026-10-27
### Fixed
- Saving a new disabled entry no longer errors in an indexed section when the collection's resolver reads a value a non-live entry doesn't have (since Craft 5.11 a new disabled entry has no post date). Resolvers now only run for live elements on save; when removing a document, a failing resolver falls back to deleting by element ID
- Deleting an element now finds it whatever its status or element type, so disabled and Cockpit elements have their documents removed (from upstream 5.8.4)
- Restoring or moving an element no longer errors when it doesn't exist in one of its supported sites (from upstream 5.8.4)

### Changed
- Sync and flush now run as batched queue jobs, so large collections no longer time out or run out of memory (from upstream 5.8.4)

## 5.8.2.3 - 2026-10-08
### Fixed
- Saving an element no longer narrows the shared collection criteria for the rest of the request, which made a later sync or flush in the same process (e.g. a queue run) index only that element and delete every other document

## 5.8.2.2 - 2026-03-31
### Fixed
- Stop disabled elements being indexed during sync or flush
